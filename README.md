# BoxPlantReconstruction [CVPR 2025]
Implementation for our paper in **CVPR 2025**: *"Neural Hierarchical Decomposition for Single Image Plant Modeling. Zhihao Liu et al."*

If you are interested in 3D plant generation, please also see my related GitHub repositories: 
- [[Point-cloud Tree Reconstruction]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Point-cloud-3D-tree-reconstruction).
- [[SVDTree]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/SVDTree).

## Update logs:

Done:

- ✅ 2025/03/09. Created the repository.
- ✅ 2025/04/01. Released the **[[Source code]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Plant-Recon-25/tree/main/BoxPlantModeling)** for Plant Reconstruction completely.

To do:
- ⏳Online Demo, which will be a WebGL application.
- ⏳Contrinue writing a detailed instruction.
- ⏳(Optional) Improve the code readability.


I will continue preparing the ToDo works after the **ACM UIST submission deadline** (Apr. 09).



## Hierarchical Boxes-based Plant Reconstruction:



### Usage

Please install **Unity** (2022.3.10f1+) and **PyCharm** or higher version, then you can directly open the [[code folder]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Plant-Recon-25/tree/main/BoxPlantModeling) to execute the program.


Todo: will introduce how to customize your data,  get boxes and geometries.
