## Hierarchical Boxes-based Plant Reconstruction

## ‚òê  Overview
Our project is a premilinary exploration of combining the hierarchical learning with shape-driven procedural modeling for producing practically-usable, realistic 3D plant models.
Therefore, our project contains two key steps:

- **Part 1: BoxGen Networks:** The networks are used to produce the hierarchical boxes of plant models.
  
- **Part 2: Shape-driven Plant Modeling:** This part is to produce the final 3D plant geometries from the box structures, which is the most difficult step in terms of programming. **The algorithm of this part is entirely designed and implemented by myself.**

## ‚òê  Our Dataset Generation Tool.

**Download Link:** We have developed a series of powerful 3D plant generators in advance, to automatically synthesize the training dataset of diverse plant species.
The latest version is available at my another repository [[Modular-Tree-Modeler]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Modular-Tree-Modeler-25).

Using my dataset generation software, you can directly export your own 3D plant datasets into local disk for any personal use. The following figure shows an example of training pair of segmentation masks and 3D geometries.

ü§ì This dataset tool is more than this! Please give it a change and have a try. (**No doubt, this is an advertisement...**)

But please note that, we hold the copyright of this dataset tool. **Thus, if you intend to use it in your research project, please notify us by email.**


## ‚òê  Part-1: BoxGen Networks.

Our project includes multiple network modules for different inference steps.

**Segmentation**: The segmentation network is simply the [Swin-Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer). 

**Hierarchical Box Decoder**: 
- We implemented the hierarchical network heavily based on [StructureNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00575), with adding an independent IFN module and modifying backbone into [MolGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11973) style.
- **Code Download:** Please refer to this [folder](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Plant-Recon-25/tree/main/BoxStruNN) for the source code of this part.

IFN module:
``` bash
# training
python ./code/train_ifn.py train --data_dir data/ --epochs 300 --batch_size 32
# inference (get the latent vector from original image)
python ./code/train_ifn.py reference --image_path data/img001.png --ckpt checkpoints/latest_ifn.pth --output_dir tokens/
```

DEC module:
``` bash
# training
python ./train_box.py --exp_name 'box_vae_plant' --category 'Plant' --data_path '../data/partnetdata/plant_hier' --train_dataset 'train.txt' --epochs 180 --model_version 'model_box'
# inference (get box structures from the latent vector inferred by IFN)
python ./eval_gen_box.py --exp_name 'plant_vae_chair' --test_dataset 'test.txt' --model_epoch 180
```

The usage of of our network is the basically the same as StructureNet, so please also refer to their projects as well to get more comprehensive instructions and reference code.


## ‚òê Part-2: Shape-guided 3D Plant Construction üî•üî•

This step is the key step to obtain the final 3D plant geometry. If you don't have CG background, it's better to learn the basic usage of Unity beforehand.

#### Usage:

- **IDE**: Please first install the IDE **Unity 2022.3.10f1+** before running this program.
- **Code Download**: You can open the [[code folder]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Plant-Recon-25/tree/main/BoxPlantModeling) directly in Unity to execate this program. 
- For this step, please pay attention to this [script](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Plant-Recon-25/blob/main/BoxPlantModeling/Assets/Scripts/Plant.cs), which is the main entrance of the entire program.
- You can call the following scripts in **main.cs** to construct the final 3D plant model. And here is an [example box](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/Plant-Recon-25/blob/main/Test/test.box) structure that you can use for a quick test.


```C++
Plant plant = new Plant();   // Create a plant proxy.
UTIL.LoadPlant(plant, "PATH_TO_BOX/test.box");  // load the box structure.

this.ConstructPlantGameObjects();  // construct the plant geometry associated with a Unity GameObject.
```

After running the script above, you will see the results in GUI as follows:
